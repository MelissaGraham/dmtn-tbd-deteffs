\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

Any astrophysical question which asks, e.g., {\it "How often?"} or {\it "How many?"} about transient phenomena, such as population studies or occurrence rates, needs to know a survey's {\it detection efficiency}: the probability that a source is detected (or in other words, the fraction of all sources that are detected).

Detection efficiencies are required for many of the core science pillars of the LSST, such as transient phenomena, cosmology, and Solar System studies  (Appendix~\ref{sec:sci}).
Many other surveys use populations of synthetic sources injected into the data in order to characterize the detection efficiency (Appendix~\ref{ssec:sci_trans}).

Rubin Observatory documentation contains no requirements related to producing or serving detection efficiencies for transient {\tt DIASources} in difference images (Appendix~\ref{sec:docs}), but does contain requirements about creating source injection software and using it to characterize detected sources' {\it spuriousness} parameter (see Appendix~\ref{sec:rb}).

As described in Appendix~\ref{sec:opts}, leaving synthetic source injection and the derivation of LSST detection efficiencies for transients as a user-generated data product is a moderate risk to LSST science.

This risk could be mitigated with a bit of extra effort on behalf of Data Management (and/or the Rubin Data Production team in Operations) to (1) ensure the artificial sources injected in order to characterize spuriousness cover the range of parameters needed to determine detection efficiencies, and (2) generate and provide a table of detection efficiencies.

The range of parameters that should be covered, and an example use-case of the table of detection efficiencies, is provided in Section~\ref{sec:proposal}. 

Readers should refer to the Data Products Definitions Document \citedsp{LSE-163} for more information about DIA, difference images, and {\tt DIASources}.
Detection efficiencies of extended difference-image sources (e.g., light echoes, trailed moving objects), or for variable or static point-sources in direct images, are beyond the scope of this document.

\section{Proposed Detection Efficiency Matrix}\label{sec:proposal}

{\bf Detection:} as described in the SRD and DPDD, sources in difference images with a signal-to-noise ratio $SNR > {transSNR} = 5$ will be considered {\it detected} and will become a {\tt DIASource}.
 
{\bf Detection Efficiency:} The probability that a true astrophysical source of a given magnitude is detected and becomes a {\tt DIASource}. In other words, the fraction of all true astrophysical sources of a given magnitude that are detected and become {\tt DIASources}. 

Characterizing detection efficiency requires knowing how many sources were in the field of the image (and their brightnesses), which is only be possible if ``truth" is somehow known from, e.g., co-temporal imaging data of superior quality -- which almost never exists because it is inefficient to duplicate data.

Instead, the detection efficiency is typically characterized by simulating and injecting synthetic sources into images, using a point-spread function shape like real astrophysical sources, and then processing the images with the survey's difference image analysis pipeline and measuring the fraction recovered.

The detection efficiency can be characterized as $\eta(m)$, where $m$ is the apparent magnitude of the time-changing component with respect to the template image, and $\eta$ is a value between $0$ and $1$ that represents the probability that the source would be detected in the difference image.
As described in Appendix~\ref{sec:sci}, $\eta$ depends on more than just $m$, and is a function of the parameters ($\vv{P}$) listed in Table \ref{tab:eta_pars}.

An accurate measure of $\eta(m,\vv{P})$ for every pixel of every difference image is technologically unfeasible.
Instead, an analytic model for $\eta(m,\vv{P})$ can be built, so long as the synthetic sources cover the full range of $m$ and $\vv{P}$.

As described in Appendix~\ref{sec:sci}, for $\eta(m,\vv{P})$ the synthetic sources do {\it not} need to accurately represent astrophysical transient types in terms of their colors, redshifts, host offsets, durations, light curves, etc.
That aspect of the analysis is best left to the user to handle for their particular type of object, as described in Section~\ref{sec:proposal}.

A specific example of how users might apply $\eta(m,\vv{P})$ in their analysis is provided in Appendix~\ref{ssec:sci_cfht}.
Generally, it would involve simulating a set of light curves for the object type of interest (e.g., normal $0.1<z<0.5$ Type Ia supernovae), and then using the detection efficiency table to evaluate the fraction that would be ``identified" in a given time-frame (where ``identified" might have specific criteria, such as a reliable photometric classification).
This is typically done as part of an MC analysis in order to marginalize over intrinsic distributions of, e.g., the brightness or host offsets of the object type of interest.

\begin{tabular}{|p{3.1cm}|p{12cm}|}
\hline
{\bf Parameter} & {\bf Description} \\
\hline
%Apparent Magnitude & Typically, $\eta$ decreases for fainter objects (and brighter objects due to saturation). \\
%\hline
Surface Brightness & Typically, $\eta$ decreases for objects embedded in brighter host galaxies. \\
\hline
Static-Source Offset & Sometimes, $\eta$ decreases for objects that are near (i.e., overlap the point-spread function of) static sources (e.g., stars, galaxy cores, especially if cuspy in profile). \\
\hline
CCD Location & With some instruments, $\eta$ decreases near the CCD edges due to distortion. \\
\hline
Image FWHM & The value of $\eta$ can decrease for extreme FWHM differences from the template (i.e., very good or very poor seeing). \\
\hline
Image Airmass & LSST images will experience differential chromatic refraction which affects image subtraction \citedsp{DMTN-037}, and thus potentially also $\eta$. \\
\hline
Sky Brightness & Typically, $\eta$ decreases when the sky background is bright or has a strong gradient (e.g., during twilight, near the moon). \\
\hline
Sky Cloud Cover & Extinction will affect $\eta$ by degrading the image magnitude limit. \\
